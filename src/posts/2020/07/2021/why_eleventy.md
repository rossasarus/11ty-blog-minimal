Blogging is admittedly kind of old-school nowadays. I might as well be writing notes on punch cards or uploading files to a BBS! There are definitely **still a lot of benefits to putting your ideas on the internet**. My main motivation is that publicly documenting things tends to mean that I do a better job in comparison to more private notes, and blogging makes it easier (for me) to stumble upon via future searches. Yes - it feels weird to make content on a site so I can later find my own content via google, but that's the way it works out best for me.

# Why blog?

Blogging is admittedly kind of old-school nowadays. I might as well be writing notes on punch cards or uploading files to a BBS! There are definitely **still a lot of benefits to putting your ideas on the internet**. My main motivation is that publicly documenting things tends to mean that I do a better job in comparison to more private notes, and blogging makes it easier (for me) to stumble upon via future searches. Yes - it feels weird to make content on a site so I can later find my own content via google, but that's the way it works out best for me.

Twitter seems to be a great wealth of info for programming trends, but only as long as you have your face in the firehose. Searching twitter is a hot mess, and I never have good luck finding anything unless I remember exactly who wrote it. Even then I often hit a dead end.

 More generically - in the past I've found that documenting **anything** has great benefits: 
- The mere fact that I'm writing it down means that I am forced to ask more questions (and answer them) about WHY something is the way it is.
- It's very rare that one question finds its answer without another question coming up along the way. These chained questions can be great motivation to keep digging and as a result end up building a more powerful mental model.
- Having a place to put my answers means that I want to ask more questions (or rather find more answers)
- The mere fact that I've written what the problem and the answer are mean that I will likely use very similar wording if I ever search for it again.
