title: This is me - Ross Daly

He/Him. Software Engineer. I've been a nerd since birth.
- I like scraping and poking at things and asking "what would happen if we did...?"
- I've worked in Ruby/Rails and Node backends, and React frontends with Redux.
- I'm a bootcamp grad, and I started working as a software engineer at age 40.
- I went to space camp as a kid, I love robots and learning. 
+ I spend a lot of time thinking about how my brain works best and how I can learn/communicate/grow most efficiently.
